AI Chatbot

This is a simple AI Chatbot built using Java for the CodeAlpha Internship. The chatbot can handle basic conversations, respond to predefined queries, and be extended with machine learning techniques for more advanced interactions.

Features

Basic natural language processing

Rule-based responses

Easy to extend and customize

Command-line interface for interaction

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Java

Libraries Used: Java Swing (for GUI, if applicable), Regular Expressions, File Handling (for storing responses)

Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later

An IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, or VS Code) or a text editor

Git (optional, for version control)

Installation


Compile the Java Files
javac Chatbot.java

Run the Chatbot
java Chatbot

Usage

Run the program and start chatting with the AI chatbot.

Type a question or a statement, and the chatbot will respond based on predefined rules.

Modify the responses.txt file (if used) to add custom responses.

Example Interaction

User: Hi
Chatbot: Hello! How can I assist you today?

User: What is your name?
Chatbot: I am your AI Chatbot.

Customization

Modify the Chatbot.java file to add more response rules.

Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries like Apache OpenNLP or Stanford NLP for more intelligent responses.

Convert the chatbot into a GUI-based application using Java Swing or JavaFX.

Future Improvements

Integrate with a database for better response management.

Implement machine learning for adaptive responses.

Deploy as a web application using Spring Boot.
